# Image-compression-matlab
# This is a image compression algoithm using matlab. It uses lossy compression, i.e. the image loses quality as the compression is increased.
#It uses DCT( discrete cosine transform) to compress the image. During testing the algorithm reduced the size of the image by roughly 65-75 percent.
